        <p class="blockRight text inBlack"> Now one day it happened that a banquet was being held in the castle, and she
            said to the cook, "May I go up for a little while and take a look? I will stand outside the door." The cook
            answered, "Yes, go ahead. But you have to be back here in a half hour and carry out the ashes." Then she
            took her oil lamp and went into her cubbyhole. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="block2">
        <p class="block text inBlack" id="sunText">Taking off her fur cloak, she washed the soot from her hands and face
            so that her full
            beauty again came to light. Then she opened the nut and took out her dress that glistened like the sun. And
            after she had done all this she went upstairs to the banquet.</p>
        <img src="images/sundress.png" id="sunDress">
        <p class="block text inBlack" id="gasp"> Everyone stepped out of her way, for no one knew her, and everyone
            thought that
            she was a princess. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="block3">
        <p class="block text inBlack">The king approached her, reached his hand out to her, and danced with her, and
            thought in his heart, </p>
        <p class="block quote inWhite">"My eyes have never before seen such beauty."</p>
        <center><img src="images/heartbeat.gif" id="heartbeat"></center>
    </div>
    <div id="block4">
        <p class="block text inBlack">When the dance had ended, she curtsied, and while the king was looking around, she
            disappeared, and no one knew where she had gone. Now she had run back to her cubbyhole, quickly taken off
            her dress, blackened her hands and face, put on the fur cloak, and was once again All-Kinds-of-Fur.</p>
        <p class="block text inBlack">After she had returned to the kitchen and was about to set to work and sweep up
            the ashes, the cook said, "That's enough until tomorrow. Make the king's soup for me, so I can have a look
            upstairs, but don't let a hair fall into it, or in the future there will nothing more for you to eat." Then
            the cook went away, and All-Kinds-of-Fur made soup for the king. She made bread soup, and as good as she
            knew how. When it was done, she got her golden ring from the cubbyhole and placed it in the bowl that the
            soup was in.</p>
