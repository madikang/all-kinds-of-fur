            daylight. Now it came to pass that the king who owned these woods was hunting in them. When his dogs

                strange animal, like none we have ever seen before, is lying in the hollow tree. There are a thousand
                kinds of fur on its skin. It is just lying there asleep." The king said, "See if you can capture it
                alive, then tie it onto the cart and bring it along."</p>

                cried out, "I am a poor child who has been abandoned by her father and mother. Have pity on me and take
                me with you." Then they said, "All-Kinds-of-Fur, you are good for the kitchen. Come with us. You can
                sweep up the ashes." Thus they set her on the cart and drove her home to the royal castle. </p>
